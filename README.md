# PubMed Health Insights: TCR Repertoire Sequencing Literature Analysis

An end-to-end NLP and machine learning pipeline that automatically fetches, structures, and classifies biomedical research abstracts using the PubMed API, Claude LLM, and scikit-learn.

## Motivation

The biomedical literature grows faster than any researcher can track. For a field like TCR repertoire sequencing — which spans immunology, oncology, infectious disease, and computational biology — keeping up with what kinds of research are being published, what diseases are being studied, and where the field is heading is a real challenge.

This project asks: **can we use LLMs and classical ML to automatically extract structured insight from unstructured biomedical text at scale?**

The answer turns out to be yes — and the results surface some genuinely interesting patterns in where the field is going.

## Pipeline Overview

**Step 1 — Data ingestion (`scripts/fetch_abstracts.py`)**  
Queries the NCBI E-utilities API for a given search term and fetches up to 200 abstracts with titles, PMIDs, and publication years. No API key required for basic access.

**Step 2 — LLM feature extraction (`scripts/extract_features.py`)**  
Passes each abstract to Claude (claude-haiku) with a structured prompt, extracting six fields per paper:
- `study_type` — clinical, basic_research, computational, or review
- `sample_size` — number of human subjects if mentioned
- `technology` — sequencing platform or analysis method
- `disease_focus` — primary disease or condition
- `key_finding` — one-sentence summary of the main result
- `clinical_relevance` — high, medium, or low

**Step 3 — ML classification (`scripts/train_classifier.py`)**  
Trains a logistic regression classifier on TF-IDF vectorized abstracts to predict study type. Evaluates with a held-out test set and produces a confusion matrix and per-class performance metrics.

## Key Findings

**The TCR repertoire literature is overwhelmingly oncology-focused.**  
Cancer and its subtypes (NSCLC, TNBC, colorectal, glioblastoma, melanoma) dominate the disease landscape. When cancer-related entries are combined, they account for the majority of disease-focused papers — dwarfing all other conditions.

**COVID-19 remains a significant presence.**  
Despite being several years post-pandemic, COVID-19 is the second most common disease focus in the dataset, reflecting the lasting influence of pandemic-era immune response research on the TCR repertoire field.

**The field skews clinical, but computational research is growing.**  
86 of 200 papers (43%) are clinical studies involving human subjects. Computational papers — focused on HLA binding prediction, TCR-pMHC specificity, and ML-based repertoire analysis — account for 19% of the literature and represent the fastest-growing segment.

**An LLM + classical ML pipeline can learn real biology.**  
The logistic regression classifier reached 68% accuracy on a 4-class problem with only 200 training samples. More importantly, the most predictive words per class are scientifically meaningful:
- *Basic research:* `mice`, `cd8`, `cd4`, `epitopes` — animal models and T cell biology
- *Clinical:* `patients`, `blood`, `lung`, `breast` — human subjects and disease
- *Computational:* `hla`, `prediction`, `pmhc`, `sequences` — bioinformatics tools
- *Review:* `advances`, `approaches`, `therapeutic` — synthesis language

The model is not memorizing noise — it's capturing real distinctions between research paradigms.
